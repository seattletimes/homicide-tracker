Alcantar, now 21, was arrested at a bus stop a mile from the family home with blood on his hands and clothing. He was initially charged with first-degree assault domestic violence but the charge was amended to second-degree murder domestic violence after his mother was taken off life support. Court records indicate Alcantar has been diagnosed with a serious mental illness and it appears unlikely he will be found competent to stand trial.",
